# Contributing to K8sGPT operator
Instructions to help with developing the operator

## Description
The operator has been bootstrapped with kubebuilder which also leverages a Makefile for
development operations
## Installing/Updating CRDs
By invoking `make install` you will install to your current K8s cluster the K8sGPT CRDs.

There will be times when your feature work will require a CRD update, after changing the corresponding
GO API struct you can simply run `make manifests` and `make install` to generate the new CRDs and deploy them
to you cluster.

Note: At the moment, you have to place the updated CRDs manually to the HELM chart's [CRD templates](https://github.com/k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt-operator/blob/main/chart/operator/templates/k8sgpt-crd.yaml)
## Running in Local Mode
In order to run your operator locally(without the need of Helm charts) you have to specify an env variable `LOCAL_MODE`, apply a K8sGPT [CR](https://github.com/k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt-operator?tab=readme-ov-file#run-the-example) and port forward K8sGPT's service.
E.g 
`LOCAL_MODE=1 make run` and `kubectl port-forward svc/k8sgpt 8080:8080`

### Local mode with out-of-cluster K8sGPT service

In a nutshell, the operator is communicating over GRPC with the K8sGPT instance which runs as a long-running [service](https://github.com/k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt/blob/main/cmd/serve/serve.go)

In the scenario where you are testing an uncomitted or unreleased K8sGPT with your operator you can run locally both the operator and the K8sGPT server,
by running again `LOCAL_MODE=1 make run` and in your local K8sGPT clone you can run `k8sgpt serve` or simply ` go run main.go serve`
Note: You should always deploy a K8sGPT Custom Resource so the operator's reconcilaition can be triggered and you can set arbitrary values for the k8sgpt's version since you will bypass them.

### Testing with GRPCurl

It is possible to test the operator's GRPC API with the grpcurl tool.
This enables you to test the K8sGPT GRPC API without the need of the K8sGPT Operator.

Example:
```
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{ "backend": "amazonbedrock", "explain": true}' localhost:8080 schema.v1.ServerService/Analyze
```
